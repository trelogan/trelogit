His father founded a marine insurance firm and was also a published poet, and his mother, who was the well-educated daughter of a London physician, was fond of music and reading. Both the Hopkins and Smith families included artists, and Gerard displayed the family skill in the detailed sketches that he made throughout his life.

Hopkins attended Cholmondeley Grammar School at Highgate from 1854 to 1863. His earliest extant poem, ""The Escorial,"" dates from this period and won Hopkins the school's poetry prize. From 1863 to 1867, he studied classics at Balliol College, Oxford University, taking first-class degrees in both Classics and ""Greats."" During college, Hopkins befriended Robert Bridges, the later English poet laureate, who was important both to Hopkins's development as a poet and his later posthumous acclaim.

In 1866, he converted to Catholicism, greatly shocking his High Church Anglican family. Hopkins studied theology at St. Beuno's College in Wales from 1874 to 1877. The Welsh language and its poetry inspired him and led to his poetical innovations and techniques such as ""sprung rhythm."" After his ordination in 1877, Hopkins served variously as a missioner, preacher, and parish priest in Oxford and London, and in the manufacturing cities of Manchester, Liverpool, and Glasgow. He also taught Latin and Greek at Stonyhurst College, Lancaster, and at University College, Dublin. His years in Ireland, marked by overwork and poor health, provoked a series of poems known as the ""terrible sonnets,"" reflecting his melancholy dejection. He died of typhoid on June 8, 1889, in Dublin.

Because Hopkins put his responsibilities as a priest before his poetry, his literary output was slim; apart from a few poems, he was not published during his own lifetime. However his experiments in prosody (especially sprung rhythm), his concept of inscape, and his use of imagery established him as a daring innovator amongst his fellow Victorian poets, one whom poet and critic John Crowe Ransom called the first modern poet.

The Gerard Manley Hopkins collection includes manuscripts, letters, and drawings. Hopkins's poetry manuscripts include ""In the Valley of the Elwy,"" ""The Loss of the Eurydice,"" ""The Sacrifice,"" and ""Spring."" Hopkins's notations for spoken performance appear on both ""In the Valley of the Elwy"" and ""Spring."" Page proofs for the first printed volume of Hopkins's poemspublished posthumously in 1918 under the editorship of English poet laureate Robert Bridgesare also present. The manuscript works are augmented by a variety of pencil sketches that demonstrate the familial artistic bent and Hopkins's skill as a draftsman. The drawings date as early as 1854 when Hopkins was ten years old and convey his observations of nature through small, yet minutely detailed, sketches of animals, plants, trees, and pastoral settings.

The collection also contains letters written by Hopkins to the Irish poet and novelist Katharine Tynan, his brother Everard Hopkins, his sister Grace Hopkins, and his father Manley Hopkins. Additional letters and drawings are by members of the Hopkins family. Of special interest is a keepsake piece of unused Honiton lace worked for Queen Victoria's wedding dress in 1839 that was given to one of Hopkins's aunts.

His stylized, ambitious poetry is still lauded by poets and critics alike for his determination to meet modernity with optimism.

The Hart Crane collection includes manuscripts and letters written by the American poet. The manuscripts include a corrected typescript and galley proofs for his epic poem The Bridge (1930). The ten Crane letters are written to his mother Grace Hart Crane, his grandmother Elizabeth B. Hart, and the poet Samuel Loveman.

Henry, whose real name was William Sydney Porter, was an American author of short stories. His works are remembered for their wit and wordplay, and often feature surprise endings, as seen in his Christmas story, ""The Gift of the Magi.""

O. Henry was born in North Carolina in 1862. He moved to Texas in 1882 and to Austin in 1884. He was employed in a variety of jobs throughout his life: pharmacist, draftsman, bank teller, and journalist. He wrote stories in his spare time and sent submissions to newspapers and magazines. From 1887 to 1891 he worked as a draftsman in the Texas General Land Office, drawing maps. He later worked as a teller at the First National Bank in Austin, where some discrepancies in bookkeeping led to him being accused of embezzling funds.

After a move to Houston in 1895, he was convicted of embezzlement and sent to prison. He served his sentence from 1898 to 1901, but continued writing and sending stories to publishers. He first adopted his O. Henry pseudonym with the publication of ""Whistling Dick's Christmas Stocking"" in December 1899. After his release from prison until his death in 1910, O. Henry lived in New York City. He wrote nearly 400 short stories in this period, including more than a year's worth of weekly stories for the New York World Sunday Magazine.

The O. Henry collection includes the handwritten, 47-page manuscript for a short story, ""The Venturers,"" in addition to several smaller manuscripts and drawings. Some of these were written for his daughter, Margaret. Also present are two photostats of map decorations from O. Henry's time at the General Land Office. The collection also contains both outgoing and incoming letters. Correspondents include his wives (Athol Estes Porter and Sara Coleman Porter), members of the Roach family (Athol's parents), Robert Underwood Johnson, and others.

He was taught at home by his mother and at the local school until he was sent to Dorchester in 1850, where he spent six years learning Latin and French among other subjects. Unable to pursue a scholarly or clerical career, from 1856 to 1862 he was apprenticed to a local architect who specialized in church restoration. Hardy left for London in 1862 and spent five years working as an assistant to architect Arthur Blomfield. While in London Hardy began writing poetry, and his satirical sketch ""How I Built Myself a House"" won a prize and was published in 1865. His first attempt at a novel was not published, although the publisher Macmillan encouraged him to keep writing.

Hardy returned to Bockhampton in 1867 and resumed architectural work. In 1870, while restoring a church in St. Juliot, he met Emma Lavinia Gifford, the rector's sister-in-law, whom he married in 1874. During this period, his first novel Desperate Remedies (1871) was published anonymously, followed by Under the Greenwood Tree (1872), A Pair of Blue Eyes (1873), and his successes Far from the Madding Crowd (1874) and The Return of the Native (1878). Hardy and Emma settled in Dorchester in 1885 at Max Gate, a large villa that Hardy designed and in which he lived for the rest of his life. His literary popularity continued with The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886), but his final two novels, Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1891) and Jude the Obscure (1895), evoked controversy. Disturbed by the public uproar, Hardy returned to writing poetry, collecting his earlier poems in Wessex Poems (1898) and publishing an epic drama in blank verse, The Dynasts, in three parts (1904-1908). Emma Hardy died suddenly in 1912 and prompted the poems that appeared in Poems 1912-13 (1913). In 1914, Hardy married his secretary, Florence Emily Dugdale.

During his long life, Hardy wrote 14 novels, more than 40 short stories, over 900 poems, two dramas, and also worked on his autobiography from 1920 to 1927. He died at Max Gate at the age of 87 in 1928. A compromise arrangement between the family and Hardy's literary executor resulted in Hardy's remains being buried in the Poet's Corner in Westminster Abbey in London, except for his heart, which was buried alongside his first wife Emma in Dorchester.

The Thomas Hardy collection contains manuscript works and correspondence by Hardy as well as Hardy-related materials created by others. The Works series contains manuscripts mainly of poetry, but also includes some of Hardy's stories, an article on Stonehenge, a paper on church restoration, a dramatic version of Tess of the d'Urbervilles, a play synopsis for Jude the Obscure, an epilogue to The Dynasts, and a few other pieces. In addition to literary works, there are also 20 architectural drawings by Hardy for the restoration of St. Juliot's Church, Cornwall, dating from 1867 to 1870.

The Correspondence series consists mainly of letters written by Hardy to multiple recipients. The largest groups of these letters were written to banker, politician, and author Sir Edward Robert Pearce Edgcumbe; playwright St. John Greer Ervine; publisher and author Sir Newman Flower; jurist and historian Frederic Harrison; and poet Sir Henry John Newbolt. A small number of letters written to Hardy are also present. The final series is made up largely of correspondence relating to Thomas Hardy and includes a few letters either written by or received by his wives Emma or Florence. Several of the letters were written to Howard Bliss.

Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph of Austria, a member of the House of Habsburg, was first offered the Mexican crown by monarchists aligned with Napoleon III in 1859. He accepted in 1863 and moved to Mexico City the following year with his wife Carlota, the former Princess Charlotte of Belgium. The new Emperor of Mexico was not welcomed by Mexican President Benito Juaréz, a liberal, and he faced opposition from conservative landowners. His brief and unstable regime came to an end in 1867 when he was captured by Republican forces and executed.

Carlota had returned to Europe in 1866 to advocate for her husband's regime. She suffered a profound mental collapse and remained in Europe where she lived in seclusion, refusing to acknowledge Maximilian's death. She died in Belgium in 1927, having survived her husband by 60 years.

The Maximilian, Emperor of Mexico collection includes approximately 400 letters exchanged by Maximilian and his consort the Empress Carlota. The letters commence during the couple's engagement and end shortly before Maximilian's execution in Querétaro, Mexico, in 1867, providing insight into the political situation in Mexico, the precariousness of the Empire under Maximilian, and controversies concerning the church, Mexican landowners, and the Juárez revolution.",NA,"Arts and Humanities","2016","Harry Ransom Center","Ballou, Jullianne","2018-01-09","3","1.2122068405151367"

He is best known today on both sides of the Mexican-American border for his Calaveras, the costumed skeletons portraying politicians, heroes, and common people that often go into circulation during Día de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead.

From Hogarth to Daumier to Covarrubias and Hirschfeld, José Guadalupe Posada's spirited imagery stands squarely within the genre of caricature and its grand timeless tradition. His broadsides, featuring folktales or corridos that were often put to music, are called upon by scholars and students studying Mexico's social and cultural climate prior to and during a decade of revolution (1910-1920). Today Posada's artwork, with its unique graphic quality, provides an authentic if not entertaining view of Mexico's people in transition from an ancient agrarian society to a more modern, industrial age.

The José Guadalupe Posada collection consists of 132 broadsides and single sheets of corridos and other songs, all drawn from the Edward Laroque Tinker collection. Many of the satirical broadsides were published by Antonio Vanegas Arroyo who, along with Posada, satirized bourgeois society during the rein of Mexican President Porfirio Díaz's dictatorship. Echoing the traditions of the nineteenth century ""Penny Press"" that were hawked on street corners, Vanegas Arroyo's tabloid-style publications were the perfect venue for Posada's creative if not macabre imagery illustrating crimes of passion, tragedies, heroic adventures, and daily gossip. Hundreds of Posada's images were published in a variety of colors on inexpensive paper; consequently few survive today due to their highly ephemeral nature.

He was taught at home by his mother and at the local school until he was sent to Dorchester in 1850, where he spent six years learning Latin and French among other subjects. Unable to pursue a scholarly or clerical career, from 1856 to 1862 he was apprenticed to a local architect who specialized in church restoration. Hardy left for London in 1862 and spent five years working as an assistant to architect Arthur Blomfield. While in London Hardy began writing poetry, and his satirical sketch ""How I Built Myself a House"" won a prize and was published in 1865. His first attempt at a novel was not published, although the publisher Macmillan encouraged him to keep writing.

Hardy returned to Bockhampton in 1867 and resumed architectural work. In 1870, while restoring a church in St. Juliot, he met Emma Lavinia Gifford, the rector's sister-in-law, whom he married in 1874. During this period, his first novel Desperate Remedies (1871) was published anonymously, followed by Under the Greenwood Tree (1872), A Pair of Blue Eyes (1873), and his successes Far from the Madding Crowd (1874) and The Return of the Native (1878). Hardy and Emma settled in Dorchester in 1885 at Max Gate, a large villa that Hardy designed and in which he lived for the rest of his life. His literary popularity continued with The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886), but his final two novels, Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1891) and Jude the Obscure (1895), evoked controversy. Disturbed by the public uproar, Hardy returned to writing poetry, collecting his earlier poems in Wessex Poems (1898) and publishing an epic drama in blank verse, The Dynasts, in three parts (1904-1908). Emma Hardy died suddenly in 1912 and prompted the poems that appeared in Poems 1912-13 (1913). In 1914, Hardy married his secretary, Florence Emily Dugdale.

During his long life, Hardy wrote 14 novels, more than 40 short stories, over 900 poems, two dramas, and also worked on his autobiography from 1920 to 1927. He died at Max Gate at the age of 87 in 1928. A compromise arrangement between the family and Hardy's literary executor resulted in Hardy's remains being buried in the Poet's Corner in Westminster Abbey in London, except for his heart, which was buried alongside his first wife Emma in Dorchester.

The Thomas Hardy collection contains manuscript works and correspondence by Hardy as well as Hardy-related materials created by others. The Works series contains manuscripts mainly of poetry, but also includes some of Hardy's stories, an article on Stonehenge, a paper on church restoration, a dramatic version of Tess of the d'Urbervilles, a play synopsis for Jude the Obscure, an epilogue to The Dynasts, and a few other pieces. In addition to literary works, there are also 20 architectural drawings by Hardy for the restoration of St. Juliot's Church, Cornwall, dating from 1867 to 1870.

The Correspondence series consists mainly of letters written by Hardy to multiple recipients. The largest groups of these letters were written to banker, politician, and author Sir Edward Robert Pearce Edgcumbe; playwright St. John Greer Ervine; publisher and author Sir Newman Flower; jurist and historian Frederic Harrison; and poet Sir Henry John Newbolt. A small number of letters written to Hardy are also present. The final series is made up largely of correspondence relating to Thomas Hardy and includes a few letters either written by or received by his wives Emma or Florence. Several of the letters were written to Howard Bliss.",NA,"Arts and Humanities","2015","Harry Ransom Center","Ballou, Jullianne","2018-02-02","3","0.8578929901123047"

The area covered is 30 km2, and the number of sites is more than 500, ranging in date from the Neolithic to the Medieval. The great majority were occupied in the period of the Greek polis of Croton. In many respects, it is closely comparable to the Metaponto survey, but with important differences. Together, the Croton and Metaponto surveys are the fullest evidence for a pattern of settlement in the Greek period, of isolated farmhouses and villages, that must have been widespread in the Greek West (and East), though nowhere more fully documented than here in southern Italy and at Chersonesos in Crimea. Fortunately the bulk of the work on both was carried out before massive transformations in the countryside had begun to seriously compromise the rural sites.

Capo Alfiere is one of a very few early inhabitation sites in this area to have been excavated extensively, with a full team of scientific specialists providing interdisciplinary studies on early farming and animal husbandry. It provides comprehensive documentation of the economy, material culture, and way of life in the central Mediterranean in the sixth and fifth millennia BC. Most notable are the remains of a wattle-and-daub hut enclosed within a massive stone wall. Unique for this area, this well-preserved structure may have been used for special purposes such as ritual, as well as for habitation.

This simple structure richly illustrates the life of fourth-century BC Metapontine farmers of modest means. Thorough interpretations of the farmhouse structure in its wider historical and socioeconomic contexts are accompanied by comprehensive analyses of the archaeological finds. Among them is detailed evidence for the family cult, a rare archaeological contribution to the study of Greek religion in Magna Grecia. The entire range of local Greek ceramics has been studied, along with a limited number of imports. Together they reveal networks within the chora and trade beyond it, involving indigenous peoples of southern Italy, mainland Greeks, and the wider Mediterranean world. Along with the studies of traditional archaeological finds, archaeobotanical analyses have illuminated the rural economy of the farmhouse and the environment of the adjacent chora. Abundant Archaic pottery also documents an important occupation, during the first great flowering of the chora in the sixth century BC.

The modest dwelling of a Greek farm family in the 6th and 4th centuries BC was modified and expanded to become the grand home of a farm manager or of a wealthy tenant of the 1st century BC. A very well-preserved kiln was excavated just below the farmhouse on the slope leading to the Basento River. This area of the chora was a particularly active center of ceramic production. This farmhouse in the Roman period documents an economic and social reality that does not appear in the literary sources or elsewhere in the archaeological record for this period. The archaeological materials from this structure include a large and representative body of the fine pottery, grey ware, in use regularly for two centuries between the period of black gloss production and the widespread imported sigillata wares of the Augustan period and later. The study of grey ware, which complements that of the extensive deposit of the tile factory at Pantanello and its kiln deposit, will be a major contribution for the history of the Late Republican period in this area of Italy. Among the residual and reused material from the site are impressive remains of an important structure that once stood nearbya Doric capital of the mid-5th century BC whose closest parallels are found in the sanctuary of Poseidonia (Paestum), and a fragmentary inscription on Greek marble with letter forms from the 5th to the 4th centuries BC.

The structure and archaeological material document the last great phase of the chora in the second half of the 4th century BC. 
The great strength of this study is its thorough study of rural domestic architecture, illustrated by the excellent reconstruction of Massimo Limoncelli including details of individual rooms and their function. The studies of the 9,400 ceramic objects are of outstanding scientific value as they establish the fullest typology for black gloss (2,280 fragments), banded ware (4,080 fragments) undecorated common ware. Of particular interest are the decorated ware, the red-figure and the Gnathia potterymaterial which prior to this study was thought to have been recovered in funerary contexts. Its use in the domestic context is clear evidence of the elevated economic status of the rural families (confirming the conclusions reached in the volumes of the Archaeological Field Survey, Bradano to Basento). The numerous terracotta fragments document in an unusually full way the religious practices and beliefs of the prominent residents of the countryside.

The hilltop site was excavated in four campaigns, 19741976 and 2008. The last of these revealed extensive occupation during the Greek period, coeval with the Classical sanctuary and Early Hellenistic farmhouse and provided some evidence for black gloss fine ware production at the site associated with the latter. The tile factory occupied a portion of the hilltop, below which lay the Greek sanctuary. Its walls in fact incorporated much cut stone that had been originally employed in a temple that crowned the hilltop. An extensive deposit, a clay pit subsequently used to dispose of wasters from the kiln and other materials, is located just above the sanctuary and partially overlies it. It was excavated over five seasons (19751976, 19801981, and 1993), and provides very abundant evidence of ceramic production. There are over two hundred crates with approximately 12,000 fragments.

Fear conditioning is widely employed to examine the mechanisms that underlie dysregulations of the fear system. Various manipulations are often used following fear acquisition to attenuate fear memories. In rodent studies, freezing is often the main output measure to quantify fear. Here, we developed data-driven criteria for defining a standard benchmark that indicates remission from conditioned fear and for identifying subgroups with differential treatment responses. These analyses will enable a better understanding of individual differences in treatment responding.

Across all three samples, SRET metrics associated most strongly with depression severity included number of words endorsed as self-descriptive and rate of accumulation of information required to decide whether adjectives were self-descriptive (i.e., drift rate). These metrics had strong intra-task and split-half reliability and high test-retest reliability across a 1-week period.

Abstract: Depressed adults often show a bias towards negative self-referent processing at the expense of positive self-referent processing. The current study assessed whether a mental imagery intervention (Positive Self Reference Training -- PSRT) delivered via the Internet could improve self-referent processing and depressive symptomatology among adults with moderate or greater depression symptoms. Participants were recruited via online methods and randomly assigned to one of two computerized interventions: active PSRT (n = 44) or control training (NTC; n = 43). The PSRT involved visualizing the self in response to different positive cues (e.g., an achievement) every other day for two weeks. The NTC provided neutral cues about objects. Self-referential processing of positive and negative adjectives and depression symptoms were measured at baseline, one week, and two weeks after initiating training. Over those two weeks, PSRT participants showed a greater increase in positive self-referent processing than did NTC participants. Negative self-referent processing and symptoms of depression declined comparably in both groups. Similarly, for both groups, increase in positive and decrease in negative self-referent processing was associated with a greater reduction in depression. These results indicate that mental imagery has the potential to improve self-referential processing, especially for positive stimuli, which may, in turn, help reduce depressive symptomatology.",NA,"Social Sciences","2017","Austin, Texas","Dainer-Best, Justin","2018-05-20","12","8.277155876159668"

Abstract: The current research examined whether carriers of the short 5-HTTLPR allele (in SLC6A4), who have been shown to selectively attend to negative information, exhibit a bias towards negative self-referent processing. The self-referent encoding task (SRET) was used to measure self-referential processing of positive and negative adjectives. Ratcliff's diffusion model isolated and extracted decision-making components from SRET responses and reaction times. Across the initial (<em>N</em> = 183) and replication (<em>N</em> = 137) studies, results indicated that short 5-HTTLPR allele carriers more easily categorized negative adjectives as self-referential (i.e., higher drift rate). Further, drift rate was associated with recall of negative self-referential stimuli. Findings across both studies provide further evidence that genetic variation may contribute to the etiology of negatively biased processing of self-referent information. Large scale studies examining the genetic contributions to negative self-referent processing may be warranted.

In each experiment, the domain is 1.85 m x 2 m with water depth of 50 mm over a 50-mm thick sediment bed. The sediment bed acts as a rough base and ensures the flows are transport-limited rather than supply-limited. At every moment the flow transports as much sediment as it is capable. The bed is composed of the same sediment as the input. 

A computer controlled pump and auger feed the sediment and water (0.355 l/s at a concentration of 1:100) mixture into a bucket with an Arduino-controlled knife valve that connects to the domain inlet by a 2 inch PVC pipe. The supplied sediment is composed of fine quartz sand, with a D50 of 171 µm and a density of 2650 kg/m3. The water level in the STEP basin is maintained by a computer controlled weir, constraining water level within 1 mm of the 50 mm above the initial sediment bed height. The tank does not recirculate, and all the sediment from the flows remains in the domain during the experiments.  

During floods, the knife valve closes for a programmed duration of 15 seconds, filling the bucket to 5.325 liters, and then opens for a flood and subsequent interflood flow. The inlet hose is placed at an angle to the bucket wall, forming a strong circulation cell in the bucket that keeps sediment in suspension. Because the system is pre-programmed through the Arduino, the floods are all the same magnitude and duration  flood discharge is 6 l/s, while interflood discharge is 0.355 l/s. This setup also allows for broad comparability across different runs with different intermittencies. Each run has the same sediment and water volume input. The frequency of floods is the only changing variable.

(Under Review). Negation in San Juan Quiahije Chatino Sign Language: The Adoption and Adaptation of Negative Emblems.  GESTURE.

In the paper, we analyze the use of negative emblems in San Juan Quiahije Chatino Sign Language.  To perform this analysis, we identified tokens of negative manual emblems in over 5 hours, 20 minutes of video recorded interaction.  We then coded the form, function, and syntactic distribution of each token.  The resulting set of annotations is deposited here. 

The original set of video recordings is deposited with the Endangered Languages Archive:  Hou, Lynn, and Mesh, Kate. 2018. Documenting Chatino Sign Language. London: SOAS, Endangered Languages Archive, ELAR. URL: https://elar.soas.ac.uk/Collection/ MPI1031992.
